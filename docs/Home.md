Message Communicator is a testing Gui for message-based communication. It is meant for senarios
when you want to test communication with other devices or software when communication is based on
simple readable messages. Message recognition is configurable and supports modes like 'Fixed Length' or
'End Symbols'. Also the transport layer supports different modes like Tcp, Udp or Serial Ports.
